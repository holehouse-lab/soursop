        Initialization function for creating a SSPRE object. The resulting object can
        then be used to calculate PRE profiles from the underlying ensemble. This
        calculation is extremely fast.

        Parameters
        ---------------

        SSProteinObject : SSProtein-derived object
            SSProtein object extracted from a SSTrajectory objected. The SSProtein
            object is the main object that most protein-based analysis is performed
            over in SOURSOP.

        tau_c : float
            tau_c is the effective correlation time, measured in nanoseconds, which
            is typically between 1 and 30.

        t_delay : float
            Total duration of the INEPT delays from the PRE experiment, as measured
            in ms. This will depend on the pulse sequence used, but is typically around
            1-30 ms for HSQC.

        R_2D : float
            Is the transverse relaxation rate of the backbone amide protons in the
            diamagnetic form of the protein, measured in Herz (i.e. 'per second').
            A value of around 10 might be expected.

        W_H : float
            Is the proton Larmor frequency, which is typically the "MHz" value
            associated with the magnet, given in Hz. For examle, a 600 MHz magnet
            would use the value 600000000. Note that the proton Larmor frequency
            at 1 Tesla = 267530000 per second per Tesla.

    def generate_PRE_profile(self, label_position, spin_label_atom='CB', target_relaxation_atom='N'):
        """
        Construct a PRE intensity profile and gamma profile based on a nitroxide spin label being placed at the label position
        position on the $spin_label_atom atom. By default this is the CB and the PRE distance to be used to asses relaxation
        comes from the CB-backbone N distances (as used in work by Meng & Lyle [1], Das [2], and Peran & Holehouse [3]).

        The PRE profile describes the intensity ratio (I_paramagnetic / I_diamagnetic), and typically varies between 0 and 1.
        When the intensity ratio ~0 the spin label dominantes relaxation and suggests the residue in question is near the
        spin label. When the intensity ratio is ~1 the relaxation is primarily through non-spin label mediated mechanisms
        suggesting the label and the residue are far apart.

        The gamma profile describes the spin-label induced amide proton relaxation rate in units of per-second, providing
        another observable that can be directly compared with experiment.

        This function is extremely fast (sub 10 seconds on a ~6000 frame ensemble).

        Parameters
        --------------

        label_position : int
            Position in the sequence at which the spin-label is located. Should ideally contain a CB atom
            (i.e. not be be glycine), else the label atom must be set to 'CA' see below.

        spin_label_atom : str (default = 'CB')
            Name of the atom upon which the spin label is located. Should really be CB but may be changed if
            a residue lacks a CB atom (e.g. a glycine is in the place of the Cys nitroxide spin labeled residue).

        target_relaxation_atom : str (default='N')
            Name of the atom where relaxation is being performed. This should be 'N' (backbone amide) as that's
            how this approach is parameterized - highly recommended that this isn't changed. If it is changed the
            method will look for an atom of this name in every residue. Again, it is STRONGLY recommended this
            isn't changed.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            Returns a 2 place tuple - tuple position 0 is the PRE intensity profile and tuple position 1 is the
            PRE H1 relaxatation profile.
