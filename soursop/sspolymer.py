def get_overlap_concentration(rg):
    """
    Function that takes the radius of gyration (Rg) in angstroms and returns 
    overlap concentration in molar units.

    The overlap concentration reflects the concentration at which a flexible
    polymer begins to 'collide' in trans with other polymers - i.e. the 
    concentration at which the chains begin to overlap.

    Parameters
    ----------

    rg : float
       Radius of gyration in Angstroms

    Return
    ------
    
    float 
        The overlap concentration in molar units
