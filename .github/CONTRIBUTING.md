# How to contribute

We welcome contributions from external contributors, and this document
describes how to merge code changes into SOURSOP. 

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository on GitHub.
* On your local machine,
  [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork of
  the repository.

## Making Changes

* Add some really awesome code to your local fork.  It's usually a [good
  idea](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/do-not-issue-pull-requests-from-your-master-branch/)
  to make changes on a
  [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
  with the branch name relating to the feature you are going to add.
* When you are ready for others to examine and comment on your new feature,
  navigate to your fork of SOURSOP on GitHub and open a [pull
  request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) (PR). Note that
  after you launch a PR from one of your fork's branches, all
  subsequent commits to that branch will be added to the open pull request
  automatically.  Each commit added to the PR will be validated for
  mergability, compilation and test suite compliance; the results of these tests
  will be visible on the PR page.
* If you're providing a new feature, you must add test cases and documentation.
* When the code is ready to go, make sure you run the test suite using pytest.
* When you're ready to be considered for merging, check the "Ready to go"
  box on the PR page to let the SOURSOP devs know that the changes are complete.
  The code will not be merged until this box is checked, the continuous
  integration returns checkmarks,
  and multiple core developers give "Approved" reviews.

# Guidelines for distinct typs of PRs
Thanks so much for considering contributing to SOURSOP! To contribute please consider the following guidelines.

### Small edits 
If your contribution is a small commit (i.e. fixing a minor bug, typo etc) please.

1. Fork and clone (as described above)
2. Make changes on your local version.
3. Ensure all tests run after changes.
4. Submit a pull request explaining (1) What the smalle changes is, (2) Why it was necessary useful, and (3) how the changes was implemented.

### New features
If your contribution is a larger commit (i.e., adding a new feature, changing inner code etc), it's probably worth raising an Issue first to ensure you're not duplicating effort and/or making changes that would impact the software goals. 

That said, to make such a change, please consider the following steps:

1. Fork and clone (as described above)
2. Make changes on your local branch and add a new feature. 
3. Ensure all tests run on your new feature.
4. Write integrated tests (using PyTest) for your new feature, being especially cognizant of defensive programming.
5. Ensure your new feature is documented appropriately in the SOURSOP docs.
6. Submit a pull request detailing explicitly (1) What your feature is, (2) Why it's useful, (3) how it's implemented and (4) pointing to the documentation.
7. Please be ready to respond to questions.

Note that the Holehouse lab reserves the right to (respectfully) decline proposed features or bug fixes, although a cogent and logical explanation will be provided in such a scenario.
