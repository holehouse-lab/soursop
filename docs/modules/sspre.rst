=========================================================

sspre contains functions related to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analysis of IDPs.

    
SSPRE is a class that takes a SSProtein objecs and can perform PRE-related calculations.
       
This is, in many ways, a purely functional class, but given it's very specific goal it is separated out into its own class in the interest of more robust modularity. 

There are a number of internal functions, but the only public facing function is the  generate_PRE_profile function below. This gives both the intensity ratio profile and  the transverse relaxation rate (Gamma_2) profiles. For more detail on the calculation of these profiles see the help associated with generate_PRE_profile function

For more information on caculation of PREs using method see the Supplementary information in the following two papers.
